# Introduction
Hello viewer and welcome to my submission for Challenge 11 aka the webscraping-challenge. For context, at the time of writing this, I am enrolled in the Data Analytics and Visualizations bootcamp with the University of MN. We are assigned a challenge homework per module. This is Module 11's challenge on web scraping. I am using a windows/PC laptop. I recently received feedback on improving my readme files so moving forward they will contain more information.

# Overview
There are two parts to this specific challenge: 1) Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles and 2) Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.-----

# Additional Information/Citations

As always shout out to my bootcamp TAs Sam and Randy for all their help answering my questions during office hours, my instructor Hunter for always being clear in his articulation of the course material, and my classmates for their encouragement and support.
